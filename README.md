# Graph-Search
Python Implementation of A* and Djikstra's algorithms. I have already defined the Graph and added Start and Goal points in the code itself.
Therefore, Simply run the program and it should display the path and the distance to goal.

The Functionality to add a new vertex, edge and heuristic does exist in my code (defined as methods in class Graph),
but I am not calling them in the program.

calling add_element() adds a new vertex to graph
calling add_heuristic() adds a new heuristic
calling define_graph() does all the above and also defines a new edge
